# Artificial Intelligence - P2
School Project for Artificial Intelligence
This project was divided in 2 parts


## Part 1

Tested methods of modelation and inference with Bayesian Networks.

Implemented in python. (file BN.py)
toposort.py was given.


## Part 2

Implemented Q-learning algorithm, that given a trajectory computes Q-values for each action.

Implemented in python. (file RL.py)
RL.py had some base code.


## Report
**The report is in portuguese**
The major part of the whole project was the report:

Part 1:
- Critical discution of the results found;
- Advanatages and disavantages of the implemented methods;
- Complexity of the solution and possible alternatives.

Part 2:
- Graphic representation of the ambient in which the agent is moving;
- Reward function, optimal policy, impact of each action in each state;
- Complexity, advantages/disavantages and alternatives.

## Tests

mainRL.py tests RL.py. Q1.npz and traj.npz are trajectories used by this test.  
mainBN.py tests BL.py
